A Drowsiness Detection System that helps prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue by monitoring their alertness level in real time. This project uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect drowsiness through facial features.

 	Features
Real-time Monitoring: Detects drowsiness using live video feed.
Eye Blink Detection: Monitors eye closure duration to identify drowsiness.
Alert System: Generates alarms when drowsiness is detected.
Scalable Design: Can be used in vehicles, workplaces, or as a standalone system.

 	Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV (for image and video processing)
dlib (for facial landmark detection)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
SciPy (for signal processing)
